# water-app

## To do:
- Allow user to input their own cell phone number so texts go to their number (currently it goes to Ankita's phone!!)
- Right now, the water fountain location is static and only refers to one water fountain. Since there are two water fountain markers on the map, it would be nice if you would get a text if you were within 100m (0.1km) of any of the two water fountains. (not really 100% necessary)
- Make website look nicer, logo, presentation etc.
